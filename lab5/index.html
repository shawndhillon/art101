			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab challenged me to work with JavaScript. Using new methods 
						and declarations that differed from CSS and HTML which we have
						been working with.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> When working with the console and code in my terminal my code 
						was initially not functioning as intended. I realized I was 
						declaring my variables and functions incorrectly. I was not 
						including the ";" at the end of my calls/declarations. 
						Upon making this change my problems were resolved.
					</code> </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall this assignment went well. I was able to use the knowledge
						I've built up working with CSS and HTML to troubleshoot and work
						with JavaScript successfully. I took time to correctly and neatly
						format my code and design my webpage in a way that ensured readability
						as well as following coding conventions.  </p>
