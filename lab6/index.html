			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> This lab challenged me to work more in depth with JavaScript.
						 I had to apply the knowledge I gained in class about
						arrays and objects and apply them. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem that arose when I was working on this assignment occured
						when I was trying to print out my object myMainRide. I struggled initially
						to print this. However, I realized I needed to address the object items and access them
						individually. Additionally I used "JSON.stringify" as well to solve this. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I used the experinces I have gained in past labs as well as the reflections
						I made for them to work through this lab. The knoweledge from class helped
						me troubleshoot my problems. Additionally, I took time to correctly and neatly
						format my code and design my webpage in a way that ensured readability
						as well as following coding conventions.
					</p>
