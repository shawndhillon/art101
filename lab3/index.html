			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> This lab challenged me to think about file structure as well as work with file structure in a practical sense to link to 
						my various lab assignments.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> At first I was unsure how to link to each lab but I was able to work through it and figure out I was linking improperly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this assignment went well. It felt like one of the easier assignments,
						 but was very practical since it taught me to use links properly. </p>
