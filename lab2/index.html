			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter </h1>

			<h1> HELLO WORLD! </h1>

			<p> Hello, my name is Shawn Dhillon. I am a third year student at UCSC majoring in Computer Science. 
						One thing about me is that I love animals! Included is a photo of my cat, cosmo.
						Additionally, I enjoy working with photoshop as shown in the photo of cosmo.</p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The lab challenged me to understand the fundamentals of both HTML and CSS,
						 applying these fundamentals in real time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I initially struggled with some uncertainty regarding whether or not I was supposed
						to use this template file or create my own from scratch. I did both but opted to use 
						this template for the final submission. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall the assignment went well. I did my best to incorporate my styling choices in the 
						site and make it look nice and neat while showing I understood the fundamentals of HTML/CSS.
					</p>
